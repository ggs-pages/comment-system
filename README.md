# Task: Comment System

Implement a commentÂ­system in PHP, Javascript and MySql Database.

  - Users can add new posts (comments)
  - Users can comment existing posts
  - Users can remove comments
  - No login/authorization required.

## Following should be considered:

  - a post should consist of the fields name, email and message
  - database tables should be created in an appropriate form
  - posts should be displayed appropriately
  - hyperlinks inside a post should be clickable in the view
  - new posts should be dynamically reloaded into the view without refreshing the site
  - focus on functionality, security and software design

## Technical requirements

  - Single page APP in javascript feeding on a json API (PHP + Database)
  - Frameworks or libraries must not be used.
  - Use git. Either publish your work in a private repo (bitbucket, for example) or send us a tarball of the repository.

## Notes:

  - Tests are more than welcome (of course, you can use your test frameworks of choice)
  - The task should be returned to us after a few days.
  - Write the source code according to your quality standard.
  - Please use git as your SCM tool.
